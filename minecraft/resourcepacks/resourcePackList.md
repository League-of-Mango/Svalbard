# Resource Pack List

This is a description of every Minecraft resource pack in this repository.

## [Verity](https://github.com/League-of-Mango/Svalbard/raw/main/minecraft/resourcepacks/Verity.zip)

**Minecraft Version 1.18.2**

An edited version of the **[Team FaithfulPack's](https://www.faithfulpack.net)** *[Classic Faithful 32x32 Programmer Art Resource Pack](https://www.faithfulpack.net/classicfaithful/32x-programmer-art)*.<br>
Not only are Vattic's old 32x32 vanilla textures present, but also textures of newer blocks are made in Vattic's style for Programmer Art.

Verity takes the Faithful pack one step further and uses some of the improved non-Programmer Art textures for some blocks as well as some small tweaks.

The tweaks that Verity makes include:
* New Wheat Textures
* New Beehive Textures
* Textures for Beehive stages
* Telescoping Piston Heads
* Colored Ping Indicators

## [Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Music Pack](https://github.com/League-of-Mango/Svalbard/blob/main/minecraft/resourcepacks/Diamond%20and%20Pearl%20Music.zip)

Changes some in-game music to remastered versions of songs from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
